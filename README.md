# Tightrope

_version 0.1 (2025-05-24)_

A solo game of intrigue and betrayal.

## Introduction

Your country has been invaded by the Opponent, a foreign malevolent power. You have been chosen as the leader of the local resistance cell. You are planning a Big Hit to incite your fellow citizens to join the resistance to the Opponent. You need to collect resources, recruit personnel and plan the Big Hit. However, the Opponent has noticed your activities and has deployed a network of informants to thwart you. Will you be able to perform the Big Hit before you run out of time?

## Game Setup

To play Tightrope you need:

- The game board (available free to print here).
- Two deck of playing cards of different colors.

Set up the game as follows:

1. Choose one of the decks of cards to be the Rebels' deck, i.e. your own deck. The other deck is the Opponent's deck.
2. Remove the Jacks, the Queens, the Kings and the Jokers from the Opponent's deck.
3. Shuffle the Rebels' deck and the Opponent's deck separately.
4. Deal 3 cards from them Opponent's deck face down. These cards are the Informants. _Important: don't reveal these cards yet!_
5. Deal yourself a hand of 3 cards from the Rebels' deck. You can look at your hand at any time.

## Goal of the Game

The game board has 6 spots, arranged as a pyramid. The goal of the game is to reach and conquer the Big Hit spot at the top of the pyramid, after completing all other levels.

Each level of the pyramid has an increasing level of difficulty:

1. To conquer spots in the first level, you need to play a hand of cards totalling at least 18 points.
2. To conquer spots in the second level, you need to play a hand of cards totalling at least 26 points.
3. To conquer the Big Hit in the third level, you need to play a hand of cards totalling at least 34 points.

Points are equal to the cards' values from 1 (Ace) to 10. Jacks, Queens, Kings and Jokers are worth zero points but can be used for special abilities.

## Game Turn

Each turn, you have these choices:

1. Draw a card from the Rebels' deck. This is possible only if you have less than 5 cards in your hand.
2. Discard any cards from your hand, and draw the same amount of cards from the Rebels' deck to your hand. After that, draw the same amount of cards, face down, from the Opponent's deck and add them to the Informants.
3. Play a Jack for special effects (see below).
4. Play any cards from your hand to conquer one of the board spots.

### Conquering the board spaces

To conquer a board space, you need to play any amount of cards from your hand, and the total of points in your hand must equal or better the total required for that level of the pyramid.

| Pyramid level | Minimum points |
|---------------|----------------|
| 1             | 18             |
| 2             | 26             |
| 3             | 34             |

Once you have played the cards from your hand, reveal the Informants: each card that you played matching a card in the Informants is a double agent and scores zero points towards your goal! You are not allowed to change the cards you played or add more cards, your decision was made!

If you managed to get the minimum number of points for that spot, you succeeded in your mission and you can cover one of the spots with one of the played cards. If you didn't, you failed, you will have to try again or try another mission. Whatever the outcome, discard the played card and the Informants. Draw enough cards from the Rebels' deck to have three cards in your hand. Draw 3 cards face down from the Opponent's deck to create the new Informants pile. For each successful mission, add one extra card to the Informants pile (e.g. if you succeeded in 2 missions, there must be 5 cards in total in the Informants pile). The Opponent noticed your success and is increasing surveillance.

If you run out of cards from the Opponent's deck, just collect the discarded Informants and shuffle them to create a new Opponent's deck. **If you run out of cards from the Rebels' deck, don't shuffle the discards.** The game is over (see Game End section).

After the cards have been dealt to your hand and the Informants pile, play resumes as normal. Choose your next mission and try to beat the minimum score.

### Special cards

The Jack, Queen, King and Joker are worth no points towards the mission goals. However, they have special effects:

- You can play a Jack at any time to reveal one of the Informants. Add the Jack to the discard pile.
- When resolving a mission, a Queen can be used to ignore the effect of one of the Informants. To do so, it must be played to fulfil a mission. Queens in your hands cannot be used. You can play more than one Queen if you wish.
- When resolving a mission, a King can be used to double the value of one of the cards played (unless the card matches an Informant). The choice can be made after the Informants are revealed. The King must be among the played cards. Kings in your hands cannot be used. You can play more than one King if you wish.
- When resolving a mission, a Joker can...

## Game End

The game can end in two ways:

1. If you manage to fulfill the goals of the Big Hit, congratulations, you won!
2. If you run out of cards from the Rebels' deck, sorry you have lost!
